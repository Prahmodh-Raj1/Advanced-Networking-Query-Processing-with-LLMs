# Advanced-Networking-Query-Processing-with-LLMs

## Description

This project aims to enhance LLMs' ability to solve numerical and theoretical queries in computer networking. It addresses the limitations of existing models in integrating mathematical reasoning with domain-specific knowledge. Using a curated dataset, **CNQueries**, sourced from trusted materials, and advanced techniques like **QLoRA**, open-source models (Mistral, Llama-2, Falcon, Gemma) are pretrained and fine-tuned using **Hugging Face Transformers**. Performance is assessed through metrics like BLEU, ROUGE, and MSE, with Mistral emerging as the most accurate. This project bridges the gap between general-purpose LLMs and domain-specific problem-solving, providing a powerful AI tool for automating network assessments and improving technical learning.
